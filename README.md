# Triangles
This code is written in Python 3.6 using matplotlib to draw a triangle of triangles. IDE was VS2015 with PTVS.

It is is like a Sierpinski triangle without the big gaps and not quite as fractal-y. Principally done to draw a doodle I did and practice using matplotlib and python and test my maths knowledge.

This code is finished and will no longer be updated by me.
